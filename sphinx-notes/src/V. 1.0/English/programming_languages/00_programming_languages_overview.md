# Programming Languages

This section is dedicated to an in-depth exploration of the primary programming languages studied throughout the academic curriculum. The goal is not merely to learn the syntax, but to understand the underlying **paradigms**, memory management techniques, and execution models that characterize each language.

From the imperative, "close-to-hardware" approach of **C**, to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with **Java** and modern high-level abstractions, these notes provide a structured guide to mastering the fundamental tools of a software developer.

### What you will find in this section:
* **Fundamentals and Syntax**: An analysis of control structures, data types, and operators.
* **Resource Management**: A focus on memory allocation (stack vs. heap), pointers, and Garbage Collection.
* **Paradigms**: Deep dives into procedural, object-oriented, functional, and concurrent programming.
* **Best Practices**: Coding conventions, design patterns, and debugging techniques.
